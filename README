Hey, a bundle of scripts I put together to run jobs on Amazon EC2

You need to have a few things
1) A condor pool to connect to
2) An EC2 account
3) A webserver the instances can pull down their tarballs
4) A way to inject work into Condor (i.e. CRAB or WMAgent)

Prerequisites
1) Get the EC2 Tools-

I unpacked the zip file and moved it to ~/.ec2 and added the following lines to my profile
export EC2_HOME=~/.ec2
export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=$EC2_HOME/pk-7JDDJALS6Z74TU64NAHYKFWZL56TOLH3.pem
export EC2_CERT=$EC2_HOME/cert-7JDDJALS6Z74TU64NAHYKFWZL56TOLH3.pem

(change your names to your particular filenames below)

2) Add an API key and SSH key, saving both on your machine
