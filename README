Here's the steps you need to take to get your very own scalable CMS compute system running with Amazon EC2

1) Sign up for amazon EC2
2) Install the EC2 command line tools to somewhere like ~/.ec2
3) Go to account-settings and create an X.509 certificate and a keypair. Save all the files with their default names into ~/.ec2
4) Chmod your keys and certificates to 600 to prevent SSH from crying later
5) the ec2 commands look for environment variables called EC2_HOME, EC2_PRIVATE_KEY and EC2_CERT (the last two variables will point to your x509 key and cert). It is useful to put those variables in either a shell script or your profile
