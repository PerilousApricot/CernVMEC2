Hey, a bundle of scripts I put together to run jobs on Amazon EC2

You need to have a few things
1) A condor pool to connect to
2) An EC2 account
3) A webserver the instances can pull down their tarballs
4) A way to inject work into Condor (i.e. CRAB or WMAgent)

Prerequisites
1) Get the EC2 Tools-

2) Add an API key and SSH key, saving both on your machine
