# Bootstrap scripts for CernVM on EC2 #

Hi, these are the scripts I use to run jobs on EC2, some things are
quick and dirty, but if you use them, patches are accepted :)

You need to have a few things
1) A condor pool to connect to
2) An EC2 account
3) A webserver the instances can pull down their tarballs
4) A way to inject work into Condor (i.e. CRAB or WMAgent)

## Prerequisites ##
1. Get the EC2 Tools-
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351

I unpacked the zip file and moved it to ~/.ec2 and added the following lines to my profile

(The private key and cert are generated on the site)
export EC2_HOME=~/.ec2
export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin
(change your names to your particular filenames below)

2. Add an API key and SSH key, saving both on your machine
    I added the following lines to the profile:
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=$EC2_HOME/pk-7JDDJALS6Z74TU64NAHYKFWZL56TOLH3.pem
export EC2_CERT=$EC2_HOME/cert-7JDDJALS6Z74TU64NAHYKFWZL56TOLH3.pem

I also added the ssh private key to ~/.ec2

3. Create a tarfile with any additional dependencies you need and name it pythonbundle.tar
 (we use this to ship along python2.6 with some other dependencies)

4. Use updateSandbox.sh to create a sandbox, and place it on a publically viewable webserver
    we use git to make sure that changes are tracked, make sure you commi to the repo before
	making a tarball

## Running ##
Actually running the instances is simple.

./amiSlave.pl -start

Will give you the required options such as
* -proxy (directs to a squid proxy for CVMFS and CMSSW)
* -startupTarball (http address of tarball that whill be unpacked)
* -ami -amk (image/kernel ID for amazon)
* -targetPool (location of the condor host)

The -stop/status options don't work yet, I just used ec2-desribe-instances to tell me what I needed.

Things are pretty quick and dirty, so there are some raw edges. Feel free to mail me with any quesions.
